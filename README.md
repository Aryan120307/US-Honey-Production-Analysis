## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on U.S. honey production data to uncover
**state-wise price variations**, **production trends**, and the **relationship between bee colonies and honey output**.

The goal is to transform raw agricultural data into **meaningful insights** using Python and data visualization techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze **average honey prices across U.S. states**
- Study **honey production trends** over the years
- Understand the relationship between **bee colonies and production**
- Practice real-world **EDA and visualization workflows**

---

## 🧠 Key Questions Answered
- Which states have higher average honey prices?
- Does an increase in bee colonies lead to higher honey production?
- How does production vary across different regions?

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data cleaning & manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included
- State-wise average honey price (Bar Chart)
- Bee colonies vs honey production (Scatter Plot)
- Trend-based insights from aggregated data

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Honey prices vary significantly across U.S. states  
- A limited number of states dominate overall production  
- Higher numbers of bee colonies generally correlate with increased honey production, though variability exists  

---

## 🏢 Business Impact
- Helps identify **high-performing states** in honey production
- Supports **agricultural planning and forecasting**
- Demonstrates how EDA can support **data-driven decision-making**
